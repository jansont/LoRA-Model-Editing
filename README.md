# Lora Model Editing

Lora Model Edit is a library for editing factual knowledge in GPT-like models using targeted placement of low-rank adaptation (LoRA). 

[LoRA](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA)
is used for model editing purposes and was adapted for this project. 

[TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/tree/main/transformer_lens) is used by the grafting method and was adapted to support fine-tuned models.
